PosterPal
=========

This was an app I made for the Harvard Hackfest. If a user takes a picture of an event poster with PosterPal, the event date/times are automatically extracted with OCR, and can be automatically added to iCal. This won first place in the Media and Advertising Category at the hackathon.

This app is still a work in progress - things to do include improving the date/time regex expressions, and enabling functionality with iOS 8.
